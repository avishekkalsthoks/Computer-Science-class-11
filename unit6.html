<h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>

<!-- What is HTML Section -->
<div class="section">
<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is used to
create web pages for exchanging data and information over the internet. HTML
files themselves are text files containing several tags and attributes. HTML was
developed by Tim Berners-Lee and is based on SGML (Standard Generalized
Markup Language). Web browsers interpret these tags and attributes to display
the content of the page. The different versions of HTML include: HTML,
HTML+, HTML 1.0, HTML 2.0, HTML 3.2, HTML 4.01, and now HTML
5.0.</p>
</div>

<!-- Uses of HTML Section -->
<div class="section">
<h2>Use of HTML</h2>


<ul>
<li>It is used to create the basic layout or design of web pages.</li>
<li>Without HTML, the World Wide Web wouldn't exist.</li>
<li>It allows embedding of images, videos, audio, etc.</li>
<li>It allows customization and formatting of characters such as bold,
italic, underline, etc.</li>
<li>It helps in creating links and lists.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!-- Advantages and Disadvantages of HTML -->
<div class="section">
<h2>Advantages of HTML</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is easy to use, flexible, and user-friendly.</li>
<li>Supported by all web browsers and operating systems (Macintosh,
Windows, Unix, etc.).</li>
<li>Content is easier to modify and obtain.</li>
<li>Compatible with all search engines.</li>
<li>HTML 5.0 comes with several new and advanced features.</li>
<li>HTML files take a short period of time to load.</li>
<li>Several tutorials are easily available for learning HTML.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disadvantages of HTML</h2>
<ul class="list-style">
<li>It is difficult to create attractive and interactive web pages using
only HTML (other technologies like PHP, JavaScript, SQL, etc. are needed).</li>
<li>HTML cannot be used to create dynamic web pages.</li>


<li>HTML is a scripting language, not a programming language.</li>
<li>There are several incompatibilities with HTML versions.</li>
<li>No complete, universally accepted standard for HTML.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!-- HTML Tags Section -->
<div class="section">
<h2>HTML Tags</h2>
<p>HTML tags are the instructions or commands given to the web
browser to organize text, images, and other web page components. HTML tags
are written inside angular brackets <code>&lt;&gt;</code>.</p>

<h3>Types of HTML Tags</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pair Tags:</strong> Tags that have both opening and
closing tags. They are also called container tags. The opening tag is written with
<code>&lt;tag&gt;</code> and the closing tag with
<code>&lt;/tag&gt;</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Singular Tags:</strong> Tags that have only an opening
tag with no closing tag. These are also called empty tags (e.g.,
<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Note:</h3>
<p>HTML tags and attributes are not case-sensitive.</p>
</div>

<!-- Attributes in HTML Section -->
<div class="section">
<h2>Attributes in HTML</h2>


<p>Attributes are the descriptive properties of HTML tags that provide
additional features. They allow designers to customize and modify several
components of web pages according to their requirements.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> tag has the following
attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bgcolor</code>: Used to set the background color.</li>
<li><code>text</code>: Used to change the color of the text.</li>
<li><code>background</code>: Used to set an image as the
background.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!-- Steps to write and execute HTML Section -->
<div class="section">
<h2>Steps to Write and Execute an HTML Document</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write all HTML tags, attributes, and related information in a text
editor (e.g., Notepad).</li>
<li>Save your document with the .html extension (e.g.,
<code>sample.html</code>).</li>
<li>Execute the HTML file by opening it in any web browser.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!-- Terminologies in Web Designing -->
<div class="section">
<h2>Common Terminologies in Web Designing</h2>
<h3>Webpage</h3>

<p>A webpage is an HTML document or a document in another scripting
language that displays information in the form of text, images, or other
components over the internet.</p>

<h3>Website</h3>
<p>A website is a collection of interrelated web pages connected by
hyperlinks. It contains information and resources that may be related across
different pages.</p>

<h3>Home Page</h3>
<p>The introductory page that loads first when a website is accessed.</p>

<h3>Web Browser</h3>
<p>A web browser is an application that accesses and displays web pages
via the HTTP protocol. Examples: Google Chrome, Internet Explorer (Microsoft
Edge), Safari, Mozilla Firefox, etc.</p>

<h3>URL</h3>
<p>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is the standard way of
referencing a protocol, host, and directory. For example:
<code>https://readersnepal.com</code></p>

<h1>DBMS (Database Management System)</h1>

<!-- Introduction to DBMS -->
<div class="section">
<h2>Data vs Information</h2>
<p><strong>Data:</strong> Raw facts and figures that have no meaning
until processed (e.g., Ram, 19, 12, Pokhara).</p>
<p><strong>Information:</strong> Meaningful data processed into a
useful form (e.g., Ram is a 19-year-old student from Pokhara-12).</p>


</div>

<!-- What is DBMS Section -->
<div class="section">
<h2>What is DBMS?</h2>
<p>A DBMS (Database Management System) is a software system used
to manage and organize data. It helps store, process, and retrieve data efficiently.
Examples: MS-Access, MySQL, Oracle, FoxPro, dBase.</p>
</div>

<!-- Advantages and Disadvantages of DBMS Section -->
<div class="section">
<h2>Advantages/Features/Importance of DBMS</h2>
<ul>
<li>Quick and easy data searching.</li>
<li>Reduces data redundancy (repetition).</li>
<li>Allows data sharing over a network.</li>
<li>Improves data security and privacy.</li>
<li>Improves data consistency (reduces variance).</li>
<li>Provides an organized way of storing data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disadvantages of DBMS</h2>
<ul>
<li>Installation and operating costs are higher.</li>
<li>Requires more disk space.</li>
<li>May have security and privacy concerns.</li>
<li>Requires technical manpower (DBA) for maintenance and
operation.</li>

</ul>
