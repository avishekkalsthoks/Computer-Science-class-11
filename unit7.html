<h1>Chapter 7: Multimedia</h1>

<!-- Introduction Section -->
<div class="section">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Multimedia consists of two words: 'Multi' and 'Media', where 'multi'
means many and 'media' refers to the way or medium of expressing information.
Hence, multimedia is the method of expressing information in various forms. The
information can be expressed in text, audio, video, graphics, and animation. We
use several forms of media for better understanding and effective communication.
By using multimedia, any information can be illustrated in greater depth.</p>
<p>Since a single form of media is inefficient for better communication
and understanding, we integrate several components of multimedia (text, audio,
video, animation, and graphics) by using a multimedia computer system. This
integration of different media forms is mandatory for effective
communication.</p>
<p>A multimedia computer system consists of both multimedia hardware
and software. Examples of hardware include printers, projectors, webcams,
microphones, and digital cameras. On the software side, programs like text editors
(MS Word), presentation tools (PowerPoint), photo editing software (Photoshop),

video editing programs (iMovie), and accounting software (Tally) are widely
used. These hardware and software tools work together to integrate multimedia
components. For example, a video can be created by integrating audio and
images.</p>

<h2>Components/Elements of Multimedia</h2>

<h3>Text</h3>
<p>Text is the collection of alphanumeric characters or any symbols. It
can be a word, a single line, or a paragraph. Text is created and customized using
text editors or word processors like MS Word or Notepad. It is the basic way of
expressing information. With multimedia software, text can be customized by
adjusting size, color, style, and more. Common text document extensions include
<code>.docx</code> and <code>.txt</code>.</p>

<h3>Graphics / Images</h3>
<p>The phrase "A picture is worth a thousand words" suggests that
images can convey more information than text. Graphics refer to pictures or
images, and the smallest element of an image is called a pixel (Picture Element).
The quality of an image is determined by its resolution, which is the number of
pixels it contains. Multimedia software like Adobe Photoshop, Corel Draw, and
Adobe InDesign can be used to edit and create graphics. Common image file
extensions include <code>.jpeg</code>, <code>.png</code>, and more.</p>

<h3>Audio</h3>
<p>Audio is an important component of multimedia that provides the
sensation of hearing. It can be used to enhance understanding of a topic. Audio
may consist of human voice, musical notes, natural sounds, or digitally
synthesized sounds. Audio is transferred as a digital signal, and examples of audio
software include Windows Media Player. Audio file extensions include
<code>.mp3</code>, <code>.wma</code>, and more.</p>

<h3>Video</h3>
<p>Video is created by capturing a sequence of still images (frames)
shown in rapid succession. The term "Frames Per Second" (FPS) is used to


describe the smoothness of video. Typically, 15-25 FPS provides smooth motion,
but 30 and 60 FPS are more common standards for devices. Video editing
software such as iMovie, Final Cut Pro, and Filmora can be used to create and
edit videos. Common video file extensions include <code>.mp4</code>,
<code>.mpeg</code>, etc.</p>

<h3>Animation</h3>
<p>Animation is the rapid display of a sequence of computer-generated

images (vectors) to create visual effects. These images are typically computer-
generated and used to express complex ideas. Animations are widely used in the

movie industry and other entertainment sectors. Animation can be 2D or 3D, with
3D animation being more realistic. Common animation software includes Maya,
AutoCAD, and Macromedia Flash. Common animation file extensions include
<code>.flv</code>, <code>.gif</code>, and more.</p>
