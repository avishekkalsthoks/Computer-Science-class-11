<h1>Chapter 8: Information Security and Cyber Law</h1>

<!-- Question 1: What is Information Technology? -->
<div class="section">
<h2>1. What is Information Technology? Describe it with its social
impacts.</h2>
<p>Information Technology (IT) is a modern concept or methodology of
communication. It is the combined form of Information and Communication
Technology (ICT), which is widely used for information flow in many fields. IT
has brought the world closer day by day, making it possible to send and receive
messages across the globe within seconds. It is extensively used in various
sectors, including education, industry, banks, research centers, hospitals, etc. IT
enables distant learning, which has revolutionized education, and it is used in
industries to control product quality and quantity. In hospitals, it helps in
management and treatment processes. IT is also widely used in animation and
entertainment sectors, and scientists use computers for research and experiments.
Space technology has become possible due to IT. While IT has a positive impact
on society, it also has some negative effects. The increasing use of IT has led to
an increase in cyber crimes, where cyber criminals can steal information, disclose
secrecy, and spread viruses, thus disturbing social peace and security.</p>

<!-- Question 2: What is Information Security? -->
<div class="section">
<h2>2. Information Security</h2>
<p>Information security refers to the process of protecting network
infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, modification, destruction, or any
malfunction. In a network or cyberspace, there is always the threat of
cyberattacks, which may result in the loss or damage of precious data. Preventive
measures, both physical and software-based, should be adopted to protect
computers from malicious activities. Information security creates a secure
environment for computers, users, and programs.</p>
<p>There are two key concepts in information security:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Threats:</strong> Possible dangers that may
cause unwanted activities in a computer system, leading to a security breach.</li>
<li><strong>Security Attacks:</strong> Attempts to gain unauthorized
access to destroy, expose, steal, or alter valuable data. These attacks are triggered
by malicious applications such as viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, and
worms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Information security is built around three major objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensures that information is only
available to authorized individuals and that no one can access or process another's
data without permission.</li>
<li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Ensures the accuracy and completeness
of data, meaning that unauthorized tampering of data is prevented.</li>
<li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensures that information is
available when required by the user, allowing quick access to valuable data at any
time.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- Question 3: What is Cryptography? -->
<div class="section">
<h2>3. Cryptography</h2>
<p>Cryptography is derived from the Greek word meaning “Secret
writing.” It is the art and science of hiding information to provide security for
communication. It is mainly used to provide secure communication between
individuals, government agencies, and military forces. Cryptography includes two
main processes: Encryption and Decryption.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encryption:</strong> The process of converting plaintext
(a readable message) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using a special
algorithm and key. This ensures that anyone attempting to read the message
cannot understand it.</li>
<li><strong>Decryption:</strong> The reverse process of encryption,
which converts the unreadable ciphertext back into the original readable message
using a key.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!-- Question 4: What is Digital Divide? -->
<div class="section">
<h2>4. What is Digital Divide?</h2>
<p>The Digital Divide refers to the gap between those who are computer
literate and those who are not. It highlights the division between technical and
non-technical individuals in the field of Information Technology (IT). While IT is
a modern technology that requires knowledge of computers, many people lack
basic computer skills. This gap is known as the Digital Divide. The term gained
prominence in the mid-1990s through political speeches and media coverage. This
division is widening, especially between urban and rural populations, the educated
and uneducated, and the rich and poor. The Digital Divide has become a global
issue, and governments are striving to bridge this gap.</p>

<!-- Question 5: What are Computer Ethics or Cyber Ethics? -->
<div class="section">
<h2>5. What are Computer Ethics or Cyber Ethics?</h2>
<p>Cyber Ethics, or computer ethics, are the set of moral principles or
codes of conduct that computer professionals should strictly follow to avoid
criminal activities in computing. Some common examples of computer ethics
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not use other people's passwords.</li>
<li>Do not steal others' information.</li>
<li>Do not use computers to harm others.</li>
<li>Do not disclose others' secrets.</li>
<li>Do not spread viruses in the network.</li>
<li>Do not copy licensed software without paying.</li>
<li>Do not alter others' data.</li>
<li>Do not take possession of others' intellectual property.</li>
<li>Do not misuse electronic transactions.</li>
<li>Do not use computers to bear false witness.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!-- Question 6: What is Cyber Crime? -->
<div class="section">
<h2>6. What is Cyber Crime? List out some examples of Cyber
Crimes.</h2>
<p>Cyber crime refers to the act of misusing computers, the Internet, or
other electronic media for criminal purposes. With the increasing use of
Information Technology, cyber crime is also on the rise. Some examples of cyber
crimes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Misuse of computers</li>
<li>Spreading viruses</li>
<li>Stealing others' information</li>
<li>Pirating licensed software</li>
<li>Disclosing others' secrets</li>
<li>Misuse of electronic transactions and media</li>
<li>Making rude and vulgar comments on the Internet</li>
<li>Alteration of data without permission</li>
<li>Spying on others' information</li>
<li>Cracking or hacking</li>
<li>Password guessing</li>
<li>Salami saving and data diddling</li>
<li>Forgery</li>
<li>DOS attacks</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!-- Question 7: What is Cyber Law? -->
<div class="section">
<h2>7. What is Cyber Law? Define and write some provisions of it.</h2>
<p>Cyber Law refers to the laws governing the use of computers, the
Internet, and other electronic media. It primarily deals with the misuse of
technology used for information flow. While cyber ethics suggest the avoidance
of cyber crimes, Cyber Law strictly defines punishments for violations of the law.
Cyber Law is in practice to support cyber ethics, and the Government of Nepal
has enacted the "Electronic Transaction Ordinance, 2005" (11th Falgun, 2061, or
18th March 2005).</p>
<p>Some key provisions of Cyber Law include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electronic and Digital Signature Law</li>
<li>Intellectual Property Laws</li>
<li>Copyright Law</li>
<li>Trademark Law</li>
<li>Semiconductor Law</li>
<li>Patent Law</li>
<li>Telecommunication Law</li>
<li>Data Protection and Privacy Law</li>
</ul>
