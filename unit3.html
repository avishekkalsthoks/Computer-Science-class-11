<h1 class="hd">Operating System Types</h1>

<h2 class="hd">A) On the basis of processing</h2>

<h3 class="hd">1) Multi-programming OS</h3>
<p>Multi-programming is a technique used in multi-user environments where
multiple user programs are executed simultaneously by a single processor. It aims
to increase the utilization of computer resources by executing portions of different
programs alternately.</p>
<p><strong>Types:</strong> Multi-tasking, Multi-processing, Multi-user.</p>

<h3 class="hd">2) Multi-tasking OS</h3>
<p>Multi-tasking OS allows multiple programs to run concurrently, primarily
in a single-user system. The system can execute tasks simultaneously, either on a
single processor or multiple processors. Examples include MS-Windows, Linux,
and MAC OS.</p>


<h3 class="hd">3) Multiprocessing OS</h3>
<p>Multiprocessing systems have more than one processor linked together to
run programs on multiple CPUs simultaneously. It supports parallel processing,
which increases program execution speed. It is costlier and more complex than
multi-programming. UNIX is a common example.</p>

<h3 class="hd">4) Time-Sharing OS</h3>
<p>Time-sharing enables multiple users located at different terminals to access
the computer system simultaneously by sharing CPU time. Processes are switched
frequently so that users receive immediate responses.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Quick response, reduces CPU idle
time.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Reliability issues, security concerns,
integrity problems.</p>

<h3 class="hd">5) Batch Processing OS</h3>
<p>Batch processing is used for jobs that do not require immediate interaction.
Jobs are grouped into batches and processed one by one. It is often used for tasks
like payroll, statistical analysis, etc. Users submit their programs and retrieve
results later.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Lack of interaction during
processing.</p>

<h3 class="hd">6) Multi-threading OS</h3>
<p>In multi-threading OS, a program is divided into smaller sub-processes
called threads. These threads are executed concurrently, increasing efficiency and
task execution speed.</p>

<h3 class="hd">7) Real-Time OS</h3>
<p>Real-time OS processes data quickly to control environments within a
predefined time. It is critical for tasks where timing is essential, such as in flight
seat availability systems, rocket launching, and manufacturing processes.</p>


<h3 class="hd">8) Online Processing OS</h3>
<p>Online processing allows transactions to be processed immediately as they
happen. Users can interact with the system during processing, and the results are
provided once processing is complete. It is simpler than real-time OS.</p>

<h2 class="hd">B) On the basis of User Interface (UI)</h2>
<p>Here are the various types of user interfaces in operating systems:</p>

<p> <ul>
<li><strong>Command Line Interface (CLI):</strong> Allows users to type
commands to interact with the system.</li>
<li><strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI):</strong> Provides visual
interaction using icons and windows.</li>

<li><strong>Touch User Interface (TUI):</strong> Optimized for touch-
based interactions, found in smartphones and tablets.</li>

<li><strong>Voice User Interface (VUI):</strong> Allows users to interact
with the system using voice commands.</li>
</ul>
