<!-- What is C Programming Section -->
<div class="section">
<h2 class="hd">What is C Programming Language?</h2>
<p>C is a High-Level Programming Language developed by Dennis
Ritchie at AT&Tâ€™s Bell Laboratories in the USA in 1970. It is a powerful
language used for both system programming and application programming,
making it often referred to as a Middle-Level Programming Language, supporting
both low-level and high-level functionalities.</p>

<!-- Terms in C Programming -->
<div class="section">
<h2 class="hd">Define the Following Terms:</h2>

<h3 class="hd">Editor</h3>
<p>The area where you type the program. C has its own text editor, but
other text editors can also be used.</p>

<h3 class="hd">Pre-processor</h3>
<p>A collection of complex codes used to instruct the machine about
certain keywords. It is written with a preceding # symbol (e.g.,
<code>#include</code>).</p>

<h3 class="hd">Compiler</h3>
<p>A software that converts the source code of high-level language into
machine-readable object code.</p>

<h3 class="hd">Linker</h3>
<p>A software that links library files with object codes and creates an
executable file (with .exe extension) that can run independently.</p>
</div>

<!-- C Language Fundamentals -->
<div class="section">

<h2>Fundamentals of C</h2>
<h3>Character Set in C Language</h3>
<p>The character set used in C includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alphabets: A-Z, a-z</li>
<li>Digits: 0-9</li>
<li>Special Symbols: ~ ! @ % ^ & * ( ) - _ + = | \ { } [ ] : ; " ' <> , . ?
/</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="hd">Comments in C</h3>
<p>Comments are non-executable text used for documentation. Two types
of comments in C:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single-line Comment:</strong> Uses <code>//</code>
symbol (e.g., <code>// This is my first program</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Multi-line Comment:</strong> Uses <code>/* */</code>
symbols (e.g., <code>/* This is a multi-line comment */</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="hd">C Tokens</h3>
<p>C Tokens are the smallest units that remain unchanged during
compilation. They include identifiers, keywords, constants, variables, and
operators.</p>

<h3 class="hd">Identifiers</h3>
<p>Identifiers are names used for variables, functions, arrays, etc., in a C
program.</p>

<h3 class="hd">Keyword</h3>


<p>Keywords are reserved words in C that cannot be used as identifiers.
Example: <code>void</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>if</code>, etc.</p>

<h3 class="hd">Data Types in C</h3>
<p>C supports the following data types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>int:</strong> Integer type (2 bytes of memory).</li>
<li><strong>float:</strong> Real numbers with decimal points (4 bytes
of memory).</li>
<li><strong>char:</strong> Single characters (1 byte of memory).</li>
<li><strong>void:</strong> Represents null or no value.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="hd">Constants and Variables</h3>
<p>Constants are fixed values that do not change during program
execution. Variables are names that store data that can change.</p>

<h3 class="hd">Statements in C</h3>
<p>A statement is a sequence of expressions that perform an operation.
Statements can be simple or compound.</p>

<h3 class="hd">Escape Sequences</h3>
<p>Escape sequences represent special characters in a string. Some
common escape sequences:</p>
<pre>
New Line: \n
Tab: \t
Null Character: \0
Quotation Mark: \"
Backslash: \\


</pre>

<h3 class="hd">Operators in C</h3>
<p>Operators are symbols used to perform operations on operands. Some
types of operators include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /</li>
<li>Relational Operators: ==, !=, >, <</li>
<li>Logical Operators: &&, ||</li>
<li>Assignment Operators: =</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="hd">Library Functions</h3>
<p>Library functions are pre-defined functions that can be used to
perform common tasks. Example functions include <code>printf()</code>,
<code>scanf()</code>, <code>abs()</code>.</p>

<h3 class="hd">Input/Output Functions</h3>
<p>Common I/O functions in C:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>printf():</strong> A formatted output function.</li>
<li><strong>scanf():</strong> A function to input values from the
user.</li>
</ul>
