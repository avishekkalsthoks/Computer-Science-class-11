<h1 class="hd">Boolean Algebra and Logic Gates</h1>

<p><strong>Boolean Algebra:</strong> Boolean algebra is the algebra of
logic, dealing with binary variables (0 and 1). It is used to analyze and design
logic circuits. It was introduced by George Boole, and is fundamental to the
operation of modern digital computers.</p>

<p><strong>Boolean Variable:</strong> A Boolean variable can only take one
of two possible values: 0 (False) or 1 (True). These variables are typically denoted
by letters such as A, B, X, Y, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Boolean Function (Logic Function):</strong> A Boolean function
is an expression formed by binary variables and operators (AND, OR, NOT) that
produces an output (either 0 or 1) based on a given set of inputs. Example: F =
XYZ’ + XY</p>

<h2 class="hd">Boolean Operators</h2>



<p><strong>AND Operator:</strong> The AND operator is represented by “.”.
It produces a result of 1 only when both inputs are 1. Example: A AND B is
represented as A.B.</p>
<p><strong>OR Operator:</strong> The OR operator is represented by “+”. It
produces a result of 0 only when both inputs are 0. Example: A OR B is
represented as A+B.</p>
<p><strong>NOT Operator:</strong> The NOT operator negates its operand.
It is represented as A’. It produces the inverse of the input: 1 for 0 and 0 for
1.</p>

<h2 class="hd">Logic Gates</h2>
<p><strong>AND Gate:</strong> This gate produces a high output (1) only
when both inputs are high. It is represented as Y = A.B.</p>
<p><strong>OR Gate:</strong> This gate produces a high output (1) if at least
one input is high. It is represented as Y = A+B.</p>
<p><strong>NOT Gate:</strong> This gate inverts the input. It is represented
as Y = A’ for input A.</p>
<p><strong>NAND Gate:</strong> The NAND gate is the inverse of the AND
gate. It produces 1 when at least one input is 0. It is represented as Y = (A.B)’.
</p>
<p><strong>NOR Gate:</strong> The NOR gate is the inverse of the OR gate.
It produces 1 only when both inputs are 0. It is represented as Y = (A+B)’. </p>
<p><strong>Exclusive OR (XOR) Gate:</strong> This gate produces a high
output (1) when the inputs are different. It is represented as Y = A’.B + A.B’.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusive NOR (XNOR) Gate:</strong> This gate produces a
high output (1) when the inputs are the same. It is represented as Y = A.B +
A’.B’.</p>

<h2 class="hd">De-Morgan's Theorem</h2>
<p><strong>First Theorem:</strong> The complement of a sum is the product
of the complements. It is represented as (A+B)’ = A’.B’.</p>
<p><strong>Second Theorem:</strong> The complement of a product is the
sum of the complements. It is represented as (A.B)’ = A’+B’.</p>
